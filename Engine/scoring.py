# Score ranges:
#   0-30:  Low Priority  — normal shopping, inbound, employees
#   31-70: Medium Priority — needs quick verify
#   71-100: High Priority — likely theft / pushout
#
# A. Kill Switches:
#   No cart detected → 0,  INBOUND → 5,  UNCLEAR → 5
#
# B. Threat Indicators (additive, OUTBOUND):
#   Base +15, EMPTY -15, PARTIAL +15,
#   FULL+BAGGED +20, FULL+UNBAGGED +45,
#   FAST +15, MEDIUM +5
#
# C. Linked damping (UNKNOWN direction only):
#   If a person is WITH the cart (linked) and direction is UNKNOWN
#   (shopping inside store), subtract 20.
#   Does NOT apply to OUTBOUND — a linked person pushing a cart out
#   the exit is exactly the pushout we want to detect.
#
# D. Abandonment (strongest signal — overrides damping):
#   Floor at 75 if outbound + merchandise (partial/full)
#   Floor at 60 if outbound + empty
#   Otherwise +35
